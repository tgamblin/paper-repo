\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
There is a fundamental tension between source-based and binary-based package
management trading off configurability for installation speed. This tension
arises from a lack of explicitly modeling ABI-compatibility in source-based
package managers, while concerns of ABI-compatibility limit configurability in
binary-based package managers.

In this paper, we provide an extension to the source-based Spack package manager
that allows for explicitly stating and reasoning about ABI-compatibility among
packages and automatically generating solutions with a minimal number of builds
by reusing and relinking ABI-compatible packages when possible. Our extension
incurs minimal overhead, while greatly extending the modeling capability of
Spack. We have also demonstrated that our approach scales well in the presence
of many opportunities for splicing. Our hope is that this extension will increase
the efficiency of Spack users, and provide a testing bed for future research on
ABI compatibility.

Currently, ABI compatibility must be specified by package
developers manually adding \asp{can\_splice} to their package classes. The
one-time effort of modeling a package's ABI can provide massive efficiency gains
for all downstream users of a package. In the future, we will develop methods
for automating ABI discovery for the Spack ecosystem in order to reduce
developer burden.
